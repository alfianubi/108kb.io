This page is describing about _What is Fariz doing right now?_ Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now), so you might not need to ask me frequently about that (like _wiiih lagi sibuk apa nih sekarang?_)

## Living

Still loving live in Bandung, Indonesia. I think Bandung still be a good city for Pedestrian. And yeah, I'm
remote worker, and usually I do coding in home, Upnormal DU, or Starbucks.

## Careers

Now I'm working as UI Engineer at [Tarsius Research](https://tarsius.id). Engineering User Interface with Rich
Web Application principle is so challenging! But in this year I have a plan to start working with enterprise-level
just for knowing how "Management" works in Software Engineering field.

## Side-project I'm working on

I have so many idea that failed before I start it. Now in my spare time, I'm curating a resources for developer
for learning. I have so many domains, and I think [codemonkey.id](https://codemonkey.id) is the good ones

## Hacking

I'm busy learning about Functional Programming, Management in Software Engineering, and some soft-skill related about
Developer/Programmer. I have no plan to learning/reading "language-specific" or "framework-specific" topics in this year,
I think my knowledge about those is enough. Something I should develop is the way I think, abstraction, and some human-related
topics in Software Engineering field.

## Books

I dont read any physical book. But I do read an ebook on my Kindle for now. I hope integration between Goodreads & my Kindle works, then you can [see it here](https://108kb.io/go/goodreads/).
