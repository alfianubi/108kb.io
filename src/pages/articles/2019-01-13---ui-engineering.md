Become Web Engineer was so challenging. The main role in building Web App are
Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, and sometimes a Fullstack Developer that
"knows" both of them.

Frontend & Backend was not a small scope. You know in the backend there are
Database engineer; designer, or an Application Developer, API Developer, etc.
Sometimes we "simplify" it by combining all of those responsibility to the
Backend Developer on general. The main reason was on "Human" factor.

In Frontend, you know the Performance/Web Performance guy. Or Mobile Web
specialist, PWA Developer (seriously, there are a company hire this role!),
Frontend Infrasctructure, etc. This case was same with above paragraph.

## How this generalize happens?

In my opinion, because there are various frameworks out there that we can easily
use. Let's see a framework like Ruby On Rails, Django, Nest, etc that give us a
power--either a developer-- to build a 'backend' with batteries included. Define
your model structure, create a migration, your model was ready to be consumed.
Define a controller & route, your API was ready to be used by the the consumer.

Framework makes this generalization happen.

Should we care how X framework handle the security? Should we care how X
framwork process the "controller"? Etc.

You don't.

Just trust them, only use public APIs to build your app. You don't need
Application Developer or API Developer to build your backend, it just works
because your framework choice.

That's why I love while I hate it.

## So this is happen on Frontend, too?

Obviously. You might heard a "Web Animation" specialist, or Web Data Visualizer.
Now, maybe all of those title are "generalized" to a Frontend Developer.
Frontend Developer should know how to deal with animation on the Web, how to
visualize a data to the client, etc.

That's how "developer" works.

Since Frontend Development getting harder nowadays, I'm grateful to Frontend
Development process become more complex. Maybe your Frontend Developer very good
in animation, but how they deal with Frontend Infrasctucture e.g. create a build
pipeline in "modern" frontend stack?

Or, how your Frontend Developer deals with the complex of DOM structure.
Rendering it on 60fps seamlessly. Deal with JavaScript bloat code/bundle size?

## Why I choose UI Engineering?

UI Engineer works closely with UI & UX Designer. I love optimizing User
Experience both for human being & business purpose. We know janky scroll is
very annoying for the user, and me, as UI Engineer should care about it.

Dealing with "Netowrk Request" while browser rendering a DOM, or like dealing
with animation while a dom in "unmount" lifecycle.

And let other "Frontend Developer" do the rest, like building a build pipeline,
keeping bundle size lean, planning a techniques for caching strategies on
frontend-level, and so on.

## What if my company doesn't need an UI Engineer?

It's all back to you. In Indonesia, we are only need a Frontend Developer who
should know anything about Frontend Development aspect. I'm okay with that until I
got burnout.

I do build an infrastructure; while building a components, maintaining a style,
animation, performance, until SEO optimization.

And yes, deciding what frameworks we will use, linters, coding standards are our job.
And write a documentation, too.

Just deal with that.

That's how smaller company with small team works.

## The Impact

We only care to our product. We don't have time to do a research, or developing
a platform, even building an internal tools to makes our development process
more efficient.

Just fucking done your job. We should deal with all of them, no matter how.

## The Conclusion

On being UI Engineer, I hope I can do more research in User Interface. Like
analyzing rendering process in the browser, deal with all possible state for our
beloved user, crafting the best experience for them, making sure all UI looks &
works seamlessly. On any device, any OS, any network condition.

Yes, I'm Frontend Developer. I know how to mount React and deal with css float &
keyframes. Fuck to data structures, semantics, and the fucking `requestAnimationFrame`.

Webpack, PostCSS, Babel, Workbox, Stylus, Lerna, Consul, Docker and MongoDB? Don't ask me.
