Okay, maybe I don't plan any resolution in this year (2019), but since my study (in the college) in the short time--hopefully--will end, I should preparing myself to be able writing & speaking in English at least until professional working proficiency-level.

Something I hope in every post I wrote in Bahasa was to become "one of the source X blog that written in Bahasa", or let's say "One of the Frontend Development blog that written in Bahasa".

Is that a thing?

Something I don't know why is 43% of my traffic came from non-Indonesia country, and then I don't know is my published post are useful/worth to read for them, my native-language audience. I'm writing with casual language, with a language/word/slang that I use everyday on my daily basis. Even I'm not received any complaint about my writing style, but today (I don't know why, again) I need to rethinking about the way I publish a post.

### Why I don't write in English?

Except that reason--which I told you in second paragraph--something I worry about writing in English is I'm not a native speaker/writer in English. Maybe that's not a big problem as long as I learn from my mistakes. My honest reason was: Big competition.

My competition in publishing a post in my niche (Frontend Development) is no longer in Indonesia scope. There are so many cool blog I've to admit like [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io) by Dan Abramov (personal), [Auth0 Blog](https://auth0.com/blog) by Auth0 (company), or some "collaborative platform" like Medium; Dev.to, and HashNode out there.

And many of them are published by the expert. Who am I in here?

### Why I want to write in English?

Except the main reason like to improving my language skills, also I hate a lot of my target audience. Sorry to say, but not all of you.

No offense, I don't write any basic topic. Like *How to send Ajax request with JavaScript*, or _How to use Bootstrap on my project_, even some harder topics like _How to use TypeScript on my NodeJS project_. I don't.

Because I'm interesting in lower-level topic like in R&D field for example. Like _How the Virtual DOM works_, _Explaining a layers in a Web Application_, even a non-technical topic like _My coding equipment_ (how can I do research without those tools which I use for my research?).

Maybe I ever published a 'tutorial' post like _HMR on create-react-app_, _Creating module on Nuxt_, _An intoruduction with NuxtJS_, etc. But that's my past, 2018. Not in 2019. I'm not interesting anymore with that because I think all documentation related with that technology was nearly perfect, so easy to understand. Too clear. Why should I "re"-write about it nowadays?

That's my first point, the second was: I hate everything. I hate you:

- Who don't know how to read the error message
- Who don't know how to solve your programming problem
- Who don't read the fucking manual
- Who don't know how to ask a (programming) question clearly

Fuck you all.

### My next plan

Maybe I will not write about that topic anymore. Let other developers (thank you, for real) do that. I know how to setup a Web app (using NodeJS) project, because the documentation is clearly explaining about that. Maybe we write with our own explanation to making the explanation easier to understand, like what I did in past. Hopefully.

My next plan, rather than "how to use ant design components on your react project" topic, I prefer to choose "how to reduce the bundle-size on your ant design components in React". Because that question need the research effort, and I love it (because that's not so boring)

### Don't trust everything I wrote

People changes as like as they want. We don't know are they lying or telling the truth, are they thought is true, etc. Never trust anything you got, until you prove it with your own, if you want.

I do write and publish it to the public/internet because I love it. I love sharing something I learnt, I love sharing about what I thought. I write this section because there is a stupid reader that "trust" everything I wrote, until he lose their own belief. Why I hate them is because I can't argue with them.

This is dangerous.

How can we improve our skills/knowledge when I say _React is good because X_ and you are always agree? I write about "NodeJS is fast" and you are always agree with me. So boring, flat.

Fuck you.

And also, I need an improvement. Everyone wants be better than the past, right? If I'm continuously talking about the same topics (obviously still in Frontend Development field), for the same level, in the same language, it means I don't have any improvement on my life.

Stuck.

Fucking comfort zone.

Fuck your _how to use DataTables in Vue project_ question.

### The last

Am I arrogant? Am I _willing to be looking sooo fucking smart_? _Feeling expert in anything_?

Your choice. If you think so, do tell me. If you love me, please remind me. I will do the same if you will, I don't wanna grow up by myself.

Honestly I will help your programming-related problem, even in the basic level (like in third statement above). But I will prevent my willing to share "basic topic" about programming-related in technologies/libraries/frameworks which have written in the fucking manual. I will decrease my frequency in writing about all of those.

Let's write something more interesting like _How to mount React component in your Vue project_, or let's learn together something harder like _How to analyze app bundle size with Webpack_, or let's do research together by _benchmarking diffing algorithm in virtual dom-powered library_.

### The pain

I need to re-read everything I wrote becuase it's written in my non-native language (even I'm too lazy to that) ok honestly I will never do that. Also, it's easy for me to losing my focus. But no problem, I will familiar with it, hopefully. _If there is a will, there is a way_, right?

Thanks for stopping by, let's grow up together. I don't care with wider competition, I don't care with different "culture" about how we read/think, I don't care about everything I don't care about. On a note, If I'm wrong, please do tell me.

And the last (I promise), grammary nazy are welcome. Without you, I can't correcting myself.

Enjoy your Saturday, love you!

Bangsat ini keren juga pake bahasa inggris gini. Goodbye _atuh_, _dong_, and _sih_ ðŸ˜‚

P.S: Because I will writing in English, I will reduce publishing a post in Medium. Let they (a new Visitor) discover my post from the Search Engine. After I confidence enough in writing in English, I will do active on Medium again
